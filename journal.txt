[03-04-2023 9:00 PM] Started a run with the same config file
Changing the ranking modes throws an error so could not try that. Need to look into it.

[04-04-2023 6:49 PM] Changed dse collection mode to parallel and heuristic to exhaustive
Hope this runs faster or better in some regard.

[UPDATE] Turns out there is no way to run the dse in any mode except hill climbing. And Hill climbing
does not need the collection mode parameter.

[04-04-2023 8:58 PM] Attempt at parallelizing the workloads
Successfully have all the 4 workloads running in parallel. Now need to figure out the implications of what I
just did.
